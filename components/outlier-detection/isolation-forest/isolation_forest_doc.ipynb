    "Outlier detection has many applications, ranging from preventing credit card fraud to detecting computer network intrusions.

The outlier detector can be used as a standalone algorithm, or to detect anomalies in the input data of another predictive model.\n",

    "Isolation forests are tree based models specifically used for outlier detection. The IF isolates observations by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature. The number of splittings required to isolate a sample is equivalent to the path length from the root node to the terminating node. This path length, averaged over a forest of random trees, is a measure of normality and is used to define an anomaly score. Outliers can typically be isolated quicker, leading to shorter paths. In the scikit-learn implementation, lower anomaly scores indicate that the probability of an observation being an outlier is higher."
