```

make test
```

The Makefile also has tests for full worked examples.

## Development

### Notes

 * Pythin 3.8 ubi can not be presently used because this would require all explainer models to be saved as python 3.8 in examples otherwise dill load issues happen.
 * KernelShap has issues for models not saved in matching pyhthon to Docker container - e.g., py36
