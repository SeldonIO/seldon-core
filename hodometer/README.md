# Hodometer

Hodometer collects and publishes anonymous usage metrics for Seldon Core v2.

## Usage

The metrics collected by Hodometer are used to understand how people interact with Seldon Core.
This includes how many Seldon Core clusters there are and how features are used.

[See below](#metrics) for the metrics we collect.

Enabling full metrics collection allows Seldon to best understand what users want.

However, you can reduce the level of information provided by changing the collection level.
Which metrics are covered by which level is documented below.

Alternatively, you can opt out entirely by simply not installing Hodometer, or by removing your existing installation of it.
This does not affect your usage of the software in any way.

## Installation

## Metrics

There are three levels of metrics that can be enabled:
* Cluster-level -- basic information about the installation
* Resource-level -- high-level details about which Seldon Core v2 resources are used
* Feature-level -- more detailed information about how resources are used

The set of metrics available at each level is:
