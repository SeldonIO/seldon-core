# 1. Modify this file with desired component image customisations and
#    secret details. Replace elements in CAPS and between square brackets
#    with actual values
#
# 2. Pass this file as an ansible extra_vars file when running the setup-seldon
#    or seldon-all playbooks:
#
#    > ansible_playbook playbooks/setup-seldon.yaml -e @playbooks/vars/set-custom-images.yaml


# By configuring `custom_image_config`, you can customise image properties
# for sets of seldon components. For example, fetching images with particular
# tags or configuring private registries. Any missing components will remain
# with their default setup.
#
# This is a list, where each items specifies:
# - components: list of components with a particular image customisation
#                - hodometer
#                - modelgateway
#                - pipelinegateway
#                - dataflow
#                - controller
#                - envoy
#                - scheduler
#                - mlserver
#                - triton
#                - rclone
#                - agent
# - image: the keys to overwrite the existing "image" helm-chart values for a
#          component
# - repository_img_prefix: [optional, default: `seldonio`]
#                          The repository prefix that should be applied to the docker image
#                          name. Typically the dockerhub user.
