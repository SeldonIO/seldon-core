## Open API V3 for Seldon Core APIÂ¶

Seldon provides initial OpenAPI 3.0 specifications for our APIs

[Seldon Core External via Ambassador](/docs-gb/reference/seldon_core_external_via_ambassador.md) 
[Seldon Core Internal microservice API](/docs-gb/reference/seldon%20_core_internal_microservice_api.md) 

The API specification is available at runtime at the `/seldon.json` path of your API endpoint.
Ensure that you're running version 0.2.4-SNAPSHOT or later, as this endpoint is only available from that version onward.
