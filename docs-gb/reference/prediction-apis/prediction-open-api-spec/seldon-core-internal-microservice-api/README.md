**Seldon Deployment Reference Types**

A SeldonDeployment is defined as a custom resource definition within Kubernetes.

If you want to learn about more practical examples of the use of the SeldonDeployment types you can check the [Inference Graph Section](../../../../routing/inference-graph.md)  Documentation .

Below is the 2nd half of the [seldondeployment\_types.go](../../../../../operator/apis/machinelearning.seldon.io/v1/seldondeployment_types.go)  file which contains the types that are used in the SeldonDeployment YAML files.<br>
