# Tempo Server

[Tempo](https://github.com/SeldonIO/tempo) is a MLOps python SDK that allows packaging custom python servers and orchestration of multiple models from python. The Tempo python SDK allows packaging of the custom code as a conda-pack environment tar ball and Cloudpickle artifacts. It has a Seldon Core runtime which allows Tempo artifacts to be run under Seldon Core.

For more details see the [Tempo documentation](https://tempo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
