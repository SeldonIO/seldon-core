# Inference

Learn about the API specification implemented in all Seldon inference servers. The specification ensures consistency and interoperability across different inference server implementations.

Seldon inference servers must respect the following API specification.

* [Seldon, KServe, NVIDIA V2 Inference API Spec](../../user-guide/inference/v2/)

In future, Seldon may provide extensions for use with Pipelines, Experiments and Explainers.
