# Pipeline Performance Tuning

This section covers various aspects of optimizing pipeline performance in Seldon Core 2, from testing methodologies to Core 2 configuration. Each subsection provides detailed guidance on different aspects of pipeline performance tuning:

## [Testing Pipelines](testing-pipelines.md)
Learn how to effectively test and optimize pipeline performance:
- Understanding pipeline latency components
- Identifying and reducing bottlenecks
- Balancing model replicas and resources

## [Core 2 Configuration](core-2-configuration.md)
Explore how to configure Core 2 components for optimal pipeline performance:
- Understanding Core 2 data processing components
- Optimizing Kafka integration
- Configuring Core 2 services

Each of these aspects plays a crucial role in achieving optimal pipeline performance. We recommend starting with testing individual models in your pipeline, then using those insights to inform your Core 2 configuration and overall pipeline optimization strategies.
