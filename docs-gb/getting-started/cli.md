# Seldon CLI

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**:  The Seldon CLI allows you to view information about underlying Seldon resources and make changes to them through the scheduler in non-Kubernetes environments. However, it cannot modify underlying manifests within a Kubernetes cluster. Therefore, using the Seldon CLI for control plane operations in a Kubernetes environment is not recommended. For more details, see [Seldon CLI](../cli/).
