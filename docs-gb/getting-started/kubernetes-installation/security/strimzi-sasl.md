# Strimzi SASL Example

Create a Strimzi Kafka cluster with SASL_SSL enabled.
This can be done with our Ansible scripts by running the following from the `ansible/` folder:

```sh
ansible-playbook playbooks/setup-ecosystem.yaml -e @../k8s/samples/ansible-strimzi-kafka-sasl-scram.yaml -e strimzi_kafka_operator_feature_gates=""
```

The referenced SASL/SCRAM YAML file looks like the below:
```yaml
# k8s/samples/ansible-strimzi-kafka-sasl-scram.yaml
seldon_kafka_cluster_values:
  broker:
    tls:
      authentication:
        type: scram-sha-512
```

This will use the Strimzi Helm chart provided in Seldon Core 2.
This will call the Strimzi cluster Helm chart provided by the project with overrides for the cluster authentication type and will also create a user `seldon` with password credentials in a Kubernetes Secret.

Install Seldon Core 2 with SASL settings using a custom values file.
This sets the secret created by Strimzi for the user created above (`seldon`) and targets the server certificate authority secret from the name of the cluster created on install of the Kafka cluster (`seldon-cluster-ca-cert`).

Configure Seldon Core 2 by setting following Helm values:

```yaml
# k8s/samples/values-strimzi-kafka-sasl-scram.yaml
kafka:
  bootstrap: seldon-kafka-bootstrap.seldon-mesh.svc.cluster.local:9093

security:
  kafka:
    protocol: SASL_SSL
    sasl:
      mechanism: SCRAM-SHA-512
      client:
        username: seldon
        secret: seldon
        passwordPath: password
    ssl:
      client:
        brokerValidationSecret: seldon-cluster-ca-cert
        brokerCaPath: /tmp/certs/kafka/broker/ca.crt
```

```sh
helm install seldon-v2 k8s/helm-charts/seldon-core-v2-setup/ -n seldon-mesh -f k8s/samples/values-strimzi-kafka-sasl-scram.yaml
```
