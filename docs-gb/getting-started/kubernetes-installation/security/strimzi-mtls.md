# Strimzi mTLS Authentication

## Cluster Setup

If you have installed Strimzi we have an example Helm chart to create a Kafka cluster for seldon and an associated user in `kafka/strimzi` folder. Ensure the `tls` is enabled with:

```yaml
broker:
  tls:
    enabled: true
    port: 9093
    listenerType: internal
    authentication:
      type: tls
```

The Ansible `setup-ecosystem` playbook will also install Strimzi and include a mTLS endpoint. See [here](../ansible.md).

## mTLS Example

Create a Kafka User `seldon` in the namespace seldon was installed. This assumes Strimzi Kafka cluster is installed in the same namespace or is running with cluster wide permissions. Our Ansible scripts to setup the ecosystem will also create this user if tls is active.

```yaml
# k8s/samples/strimzi-example-tls-user.yaml
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2
kind: KafkaUser
metadata:
  name: seldon
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: seldon
spec:
  authentication:
    type: tls
```

If you don't have this user you can install it with in your desired namespace (here `seldon-mesh`):

```sh
kubectl create -f k8s/samples/strimzi-example-tls-user.yaml -n seldon-mesh
```

Install seldon with the Strimzi certificate secrets using a custom values file. This sets
the secret created by Strimzi for the user created above (`seldon`) and targets the server
certificate authority secret from the name of the cluster created on install of the Kafka
cluster (`seldon-cluster-ca-cert`).

Configure Seldon Core 2 by setting following Helm values:

```yaml
# k8s/samples/values-strimzi-kafka-mtls.yaml
kafka:
  bootstrap: seldon-kafka-bootstrap.seldon-mesh.svc.cluster.local:9093

security:
  kafka:
    protocol: SSL
    ssl:
      client:
        secret: seldon
        brokerValidationSecret: seldon-cluster-ca-cert
        keyPath: /tmp/certs/kafka/client/user.key
        crtPath: /tmp/certs/kafka/client/user.crt
        caPath: /tmp/certs/kafka/client/ca.crt
        brokerCaPath: /tmp/certs/kafka/broker/ca.crt
```

```sh
helm install seldon-v2 k8s/helm-charts/seldon-core-v2-setup/ -n seldon-mesh -f k8s/samples/values-strimzi-kafka-mtls.yaml
```

You can now go ahead and install a SeldonRuntime in your desired install namespace (here `seldon-mesh`), e.g.

```sh
helm install seldon-v2-runtime ../k8s/helm-charts/seldon-core-v2-runtime  -n seldon-mesh
```
