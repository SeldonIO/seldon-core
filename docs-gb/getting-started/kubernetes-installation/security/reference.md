## Environment variables

Kubernetes secrets and mounted files can be used to provide the certificates in PEM format. These are controlled by environment variables for server or client depending on the component:

### Control Plane

| EnvVar | Value |
| --- | --- |
| CONTROL_PLANE_SECURITY_PROTOCOL | SSL or PLAINTEXT |

For a server (scheduler):

| EnvVar | Value |
| --- | --- |
| CONTROL_PLANE_SERVER_TLS_SECRET_NAME | (optional) the name of the namespaced secret which holds the certificates |
| CONTROL_PLANE_CLIENT_TLS_SECRET_NAME | (optional) the name of the namespaced secret which holds the validation ca roots to verify the client certificate |
| CONTROL_PLANE_SERVER_TLS_KEY_LOCATION | the path to the TLS private key |
| CONTROL_PLANE_SERVER_TLS_CRT_LOCATION | the path to the TLS certificate |
| CONTROL_PLANE_SERVER_TLS_CA_LOCATION | the path to the TLS CA chain for the server |
| CONTROL_PLANE_CLIENT_TLS_CA_LOCATION | the path to the TLS CA chain for the client for mTLS verification |
