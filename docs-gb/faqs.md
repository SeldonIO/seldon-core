# FAQs

## Should I use Core 1 or Core 2?

We strongly recommend using **Seldon Core 2** for all new and production deployments. Core 1 is now in maintenance mode â€” it is no longer actively developed, and future improvements will be focused exclusively on Core 2. Core 2 is already being supported for production use by  our enterprise-scale customers.

Seldon Core 2 introduces a more modern, scalable, and flexible architecture designed for production-grade machine learning systems. Key advantages include:

- Data-centric ML pipelines with native support for streaming data via Kafka, enabling real-time inference and observability.
- Multi-Model Serving and resource overcommit strategies that improve infrastructure efficiency and model utilization.

## Can Seldon Core 2 be used with Seldon Core 1

The two projects are able to be run side by side. Existing users of Seldon Core can update to deploy their models using Seldon Core 2 as needed to take advantage of the new functionality. 

## Can I do payload logging in Seldon Core 2?

By default, the input and output of every step in a pipeline (as well as the pipeline itself) is logged in Kafka. From there it's up to you what to do with the data. You could use something like [Kafka Connect](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/connect/index.html) to stream the logs to a datastore of your choice.

Note that there is no automatic request logging for models being accessed directly over REST or gRPC. Requests need to be sent via pipelines to be recorded in Kafka.
