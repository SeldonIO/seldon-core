# Model Scheduling

Core 2 architecture is built around decoupling `Model` and `Server` CRs to allow for multi-model deployment, 
enabling multiple models to be loaded and served on one server replica or a single `Pod`. Multi-model serving
allows for more efficient use of resources, see [Multi Model Serving](mms.md) for more information.

This architecture requires that Core 2 handles scheduling of models onto server pods natively. In particular Core 2 implements different sorters and filters which are used to find the best Server that is able to host a given Model. This process we describe in the following section.

## Scheduling Process

### Overview

The scheduling process in Core 2 identifies a suitable candidate server for a given model through a series of steps. These steps involve sorting and filtering servers primarily based on the following criteria:

- Server has matching Capabilities with Model `spec.requirements`.
- Server has enough replicas to load the desired `spec.replicas` of the Model.
- Each replica of Server has enough available memory to load one replica of the model defined in `spec.memory`.
- Server that already hosts the Model is preferred to reduce flip-flops between different candidate servers.

After a suitable candidate server is identified for a given model, Core 2 attempts to load the model onto it. If no matching server is found, the model is marked as `ScheduleFailed`.

This process is designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of new filters in future versions to enhance scheduling decisions.

**Note**: A specific Model can only be assigned to at most one Server and therefore this Server requires enough replicas to host all replicas of the Model.

## Partial Scheduling

Core 2 (from `2.9`) is able to do partial scheduling of Models. Partial scheduling is defined as the loading of enough replicas of the model above `spec.minReplicas` and upto the number of available Server replicas. This allows the user a little bit more flexibility in serving traffic while optimising infrastructure provisioning. 

To enable partial scheduling, `spec.minReplicas` needs to be defined as it provides Core 2 the minimum replicas of the model that is required for serving. 

Partial scheduling does not have an explicit state; instead, the model is marked as `ModelAvailable` and is ready to serve traffic. The status of the Model CR can be inspected, where `DESIRED REPLICAS` and `AVAILABLE REPLICAS` provide insight into the number of replicas currently loaded in Core 2. Based on this information, the following logic are applied:

- *Fully Scheduled*: READY is True and DESIRED REPLICAS is equal to AVAILABLE REPLICAS (STATUS is `ModelAvailable`)
- *Partially Scheduled*: READY is TRUE and DESIRED REPLICAS is greater than AVAILABLE REPLICAS (STATUS is `ModelAvailable`)
- *Not Scheduled*: Ready is False (Status is `ScheduleFailed`)
