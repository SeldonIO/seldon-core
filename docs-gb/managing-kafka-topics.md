# Managing Kafka Topics in Seldon Core 2

## Model Kafka topics

A [Model](./kubernetes/resources/model.md) in Seldon Core 2 represents the fundamental unit for serving a machine learning artifact within a running server instance.

If Kafka is installed in your cluster, Seldon Core automatically creates dedicated input and output topics for each model as it is loaded. These topics facilitate asynchronous messaging, enabling clients to send input messages and retrieve output responses independently and at a later time.

By default, when a model is unloaded, its associated Kafka topics are retained. This behavior supports use cases such as auditing, but it also consumes additional Kafka resources and may incur unnecessary costs for workloads that do not require persistent topics.

To manage this behavior, you can configure the `dataflow` section of the model specification. In addition to the required `storageUri` and `requirements` fields, you can optionally specify `cleanTopicsOnDelete` under `dataflow`. This boolean flag controls whether the Kafka topics should be deleted when the model is unloaded:

* If set to `false` (default), topics are retained after the model is deleted.

* If set to `true`, the input and output topics are deleted along with the model.

Here is an example of a manifest file that enables topic cleanup on deletion:
```yaml
# samples/models/sklearn-iris-gs.yaml
apiVersion: mlops.seldon.io/v1alpha1
kind: Model
metadata:
  name: iris
spec:
  dataflow:
    cleanTopicsOnDelete: true
  storageUri: "gs://seldon-models/scv2/samples/mlserver_1.5.0/iris-sklearn"
  requirements:
    - sklearn
  memory: 100Ki
```

To inspect existing Kafka topics in your cluster, you can deploy a temporary pod:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: kafka-busybox
spec:
  containers:
    - name: kafka-busybox
      image: apache/kafka:latest
      command: ["sleep", "3600"]
      imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  restartPolicy: Always
```

After the pod is running, you can access it and list topics with the following command:

```bash
kafka-busybox:/opt/kafka/bin$ ./kafka-topics.sh --list --bootstrap-server $SELDON_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_PORT_9092_TCP
```

## Deploying and verifying topic cleanup for a model

Apply the model manifest with topic cleanup enabled:
```bash
kubectl apply -f model.yaml -n seldon-mesh
```

After deployment, you can list Kafka topics from within the `kafka-busybox` pod and confirm that input/output topics have been created:
```bash
__consumer_offsets
seldon.seldon-mesh.model.iris.inputs
seldon.seldon-mesh.model.iris.outputs
```

To delete the model:
```bash
kubectl delete -f model.yaml -n seldon-mesh
```

After deletion, list the topics again. You should see that the input and output topics have been successfully removed from Kafka:
```bash
__consumer_offsets
```

## Pipeline Kafka topics

Similarly to models, when a [Pipeline](./kubernetes/resources/pipeline.md) is deployed in Seldon Core 2, Kafka input and output topics are automatically created for it. These topics enable asynchronous processing across pipeline steps.

As with models, the `cleanTopicsOnDelete` flag controls whether these topics are retained or removed when the pipeline is deleted:

* By default, topics are retained after the pipeline is unloaded.

* If `cleanTopicsOnDelete` is set to `true`, the input and output topics associated with the pipeline are deleted.

Below is an example of a pipeline manifest that wraps the previously defined model and enables topic cleanup:
```yaml
apiVersion: mlops.seldon.io/v1alpha1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: iris-pipeline
spec:
  dataflow:
    cleanTopicsOnDelete: true
  steps:
    - name: iris
  output:
    steps:
    - iris
```

## Deploying and verifying topic cleanup for a pipeline

Apply the pipeline manifest with topic cleanup enabled:
```bash
kubectl apply -f pipeline.yaml -n seldon-mesh
```

Once the pipeline is deployed, you can list the Kafka topics from inside the `kafka-busybox` pod to confirm that they have been created:
```bash
__consumer_offsets
seldon.seldon-mesh.errors.errors
seldon.seldon-mesh.model.iris.inputs
seldon.seldon-mesh.model.iris.outputs
seldon.seldon-mesh.pipeline.iris-pipeline.inputs
seldon.seldon-mesh.pipeline.iris-pipeline.outputs
```

To delete the pipeline, run:
```bash
kubectl delete -f pipeline.yaml -n seldon-mesh
```

After deletion, list the Kafka topics again. You should observe that the pipelineâ€™s input and output topics have been removed:
```bash
__consumer_offsets
seldon.seldon-mesh.errors.errors
seldon.seldon-mesh.model.iris.inputs
seldon.seldon-mesh.model.iris.outputs
```

Note: Topics associated with models used inside the pipeline are not deleted unless the corresponding models are also unloaded and the `cleanTopicsOnDelete` flag was set to `true` in their specification.
