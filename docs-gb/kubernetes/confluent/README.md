# Confluent

Seldon Core 2 requires Kafka to implement data-centric inference Pipelines. By this means it gives the
opportunity to also provide support for the ecosystem of other products from Confluent, including
Schema Registry, Connect, and ksqlDB to enable advanced data streaming and processing capabilities
for machine learning workflows. 

* [Schema Registry](schema-registry.md)

We welcome to help to extend these to other Confluent products.
