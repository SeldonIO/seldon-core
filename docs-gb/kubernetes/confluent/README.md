Seldon Core 2 leverages Kafka for implementing data-centric inference Pipelines. This also means that Core 2 users have the ability of integrating with other products from the Kafka ecosystem, such as Schema Registry, Connect or ksqlDB in order to build custom data streaming, processing and logging solutions for machine learning workflows.
