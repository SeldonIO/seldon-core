# Outlier Detector as Single Model

This chart provides a Seldon Deployment with an outlier detector used as a single model. 

Available outlier detectors are:
- [Sequence-to-Sequence LSTM](../../components/outlier-detection/seq2seq-lstm)
- [Variational Auto-Encoder](../../components/outlier-detection/vae)
- [Isolation Forest](../../components/outlier-detection/isolation-forest)
- [Mahalanobis Distance](../../components/outlier-detection/mahalanobis)
