## Documentation

To generate the documentation of our Helm charts, we use
[`helm-docs`](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs).
This tool will read the metadata included in the `Chart.yaml` and `values.yaml`
to generate a `README.md` page.

### Generating documentation locally

You can install the latest version of `helm-docs` using the `install` target of
the `Makefile`:

```shell
make install
```

Afterwards, you can use the `docs` target of the `Makefile`:

```shell
make docs
```
