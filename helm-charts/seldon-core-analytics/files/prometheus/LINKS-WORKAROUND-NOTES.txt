in helm v2.6.2 a feature that allowed sym links to be used was removed.

So to simulate the following links:

    prometheus-config.yaml -> prometheus-config-default.yaml
    rules -> rules.default

The file and dir is copied:

    prometheus-config-default.yaml copied to prometheus-config.yaml
    rules.default/ copied to rules/
