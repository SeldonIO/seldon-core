Set kubectl context to "kind-kind"
You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind

Not sure what to do next? 😅 Check out https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/
`kind get kubeconfig-path` is deprecated!

KIND will export and merge kubeconfig like kops, minikube, etc.
This command is now unnecessary and will be removed in a future release.

For more info see: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/issues/1060

Istio 1.6.8 Download Complete!

Istio has been successfully downloaded into the istio-1.6.8 folder on your system.

Next Steps:
See https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/ to add Istio to your Kubernetes cluster.

To configure the istioctl client tool for your workstation,
add the /workspace/source/testing/scripts/istio-1.6.8/bin directory to your environment path variable with:
	 export PATH="$PATH:/workspace/source/testing/scripts/istio-1.6.8/bin"

Begin the Istio pre-installation check by running:
	 istioctl x precheck 

Need more information? Visit https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/ 
istio-1.6.8/bin/istioctl install --set profile=demo
Detected that your cluster does not support third party JWT authentication. Falling back to less secure first party JWT. See https://istio.io/docs/ops/best-practices/security/#configure-third-party-service-account-tokens for details.

ERROR: After October 2020 you may experience errors when installing or updating packages. This is because pip will change the way that it resolves dependency conflicts.

We recommend you use --use-feature=2020-resolver to test your packages with the new resolver before it becomes the default.
