Set kubectl context to "kind-kind"
You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind

Have a nice day! 👋
`kind get kubeconfig-path` is deprecated!

KIND will export and merge kubeconfig like kops, minikube, etc.
This command is now unnecessary and will be removed in a future release.

For more info see: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/issues/1060

ERROR: After October 2020 you may experience errors when installing or updating packages. This is because pip will change the way that it resolves dependency conflicts.

We recommend you use --use-feature=2020-resolver to test your packages with the new resolver before it becomes the default.

grpcio-tools 1.33.2 requires grpcio>=1.33.2, but you'll have grpcio 1.32.0 which is incompatible.
alibi 0.5.2 requires tensorflow>=2.0, but you'll have tensorflow 1.15.4 which is incompatible.
grpcio-reflection 1.34.0 requires grpcio>=1.34.0, but you'll have grpcio 1.32.0 which is incompatible.
