# Example Request Logger

For use with request logging example (/examples/centralised-logging/request-logging/). The deployment yaml for this is there.

This example request logger is as general-purpose as possible. Eventually intended to read all types of CloudEvents emitted by the Seldon executor. These can be:

 - GRPC or json
 - SeldonMessages or tensorflow format
 - Tabular data, string data or image data
 - Requests, responses to main predictor or to canary or shadow (all to be aggregated)

Custom request loggers can be built for different types of transformations. Can be written in any language, just needs to handle HTTP POST requests and log to stdout for fluentd or could go direct to chosen backend.

A custom logger example is provided for a [CIFAR10 image classfier example](https://github.com/SeldonIO/alibi-detect/tree/master/integrations/samples/kfserving/od-cifar10)

# Local Testing

To try this out, run elastic locally
```
docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-oss:7.6.0
docker run -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-oss:7.6.0
```

Run seldon-core/executor/samples/local/logger but don't start the dummy_logsink. Instead run the local request logger with:
```
make run_local
```
The log output from the request-logger will show the document id and index name, which is built from the seldon deployment name and namespace (if supplied).

View the document at `localhost:9200/<index>/inferencerequest/<doc_id>`

Example output is:
