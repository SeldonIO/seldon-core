# Deploy Modular, Data-centric AI applications at scale

##  💡 About
Seldon Core 2 is an MLOps and LLMOps framework for deploying, managing and scaling AI systems in Kubernetes - from singular models, to modular and data-centric applications. With Core 2 you can deploy in a standardized way across a wide range of model types, on-prem or in any cloud, and production-ready out of the box.
