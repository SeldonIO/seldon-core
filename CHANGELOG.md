## [v2.8.5](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/releases/tag/v2.8.5) - 2024-11-07

### Overview

This release introduces stability fixes related to upgrading from previous versions and recovering from network issues gracefully (by using keepalive patterns). It also adds some usability improvements of the system.

We also improve documentations on using [HPA autoscaling](https://docs.seldon.ai/seldon-core-2/kubernetes/hpa-rps-autoscaling) and Core 2 [architecture](https://docs.seldon.ai/seldon-core-2/architecture).

### (Main) Features:

- Add keepalive settings (server-side: [`#6016`](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/pull/6016), client-side: [`#5978`](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/pull/5978))
- Expose stateful set persistent volume claim retention policy [`#5946`](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/pull/5946)
- Set a time-to-live (TTL) on deleted pipelines and experiments [`#5948`](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/pull/5948)
- Improve control plane synchronisation [`#6029`](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/pull/6029),  [`#6021`](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/pull/6021) and  [`#6020`](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/pull/6020)

### (Main) Bugs Fixed:

- Make `status.selector` field optional [`#5985`](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/pull/5985)
- Closing off envoy admin interface [`#5936`](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/pull/5936)

<a id="v2.8.4"></a>
## [v2.8.4](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/releases/tag/v2.8.4) - 2024-10-11

### Overview

This release introduces a number of features that help users run core 2 with dynamic loads. We added support for HPA model & server autoscaling based on custom metrics in the single-model-serving case. Documentation showing an example of scaling based on model RPS is described [here](https://docs.seldon.ai/seldon-core-2/kubernetes/hpa-rps-autoscaling).

This release also reduces the risk of data plane outage in the case of control plane issues (specifically when `seldon-scheduler` is restarting). This is done by synchronising the process of the scheduler (re)start with the rest of the system.

A number of features have been added, most notably users can now upgrade a model to a new version that is part of an ongoing experiment. 

We are migrating docs to a new site [here](https://docs.seldon.ai/seldon-core-2) (experimental).

### (Main) Features:

- Add gitbook support (experimental) [`#5943`](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/pull/5943)
- Add metadata object to a `seldonconfig` component [`#5918`](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/pull/5918)
- `seldon-scheduler` startup synchronisation [`#5930`](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/pull/5930)
- Envoy Grafana Dashbaord [`#5894`](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/pull/5894)
- Upgrade models in experiment [`#5874`](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/pull/5874)
- Add pipeline and model name validation [`#5872`](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/pull/5872)
- Add retry parameters [`#5875`](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/pull/5875)

### (Main) Bugs Fixed:

- Skip out of order control messages in `seldon-agent` [`#5969`](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/pull/5969)
- Use `StatefulSet.Spec.Replicas` as reference for Server status [`#5945`](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/pull/5945)
- Cleaning up models that fail to load [`#5857`](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/pull/5857) and [`#5830`](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/pull/5830)

<a id="v2.8.3"></a>
## [v2.8.3](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/releases/tag/v2.8.3) - 2024-07-17

### Overview

This release is targeted to fix the experiments worflow so that the system can deal with deleted experiments properly on restart of components, specifically `seldon-scheduler`.

As part of the work done the system can now:

- Handle different versions of the `seldon-scheduler` local embedded db (BadgerDB), with the ability to migrate to the latest version seamlessly.
- Recover the state of the scheduler from k8s if this local embedded db is corrupted / lost, which includes recovering both experiments and pipelines that exist in k8s.

### (Main) Bugs Fixed:

- scheduler/operator: Deal with deleted experiments when restoring from cache [`#5726`](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/pull/5726)
- scheduler: Do not report back draining servers for status [`#5761`](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/pull/5761)

### (Main) Features:

-  operator: add custom printcolumns for seldon-specific CRs [`#5736`](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/pull/5736)

### (Main) Upgrades:

- use mlserver 1.6.0 [`#5724`](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/pull/5724)
