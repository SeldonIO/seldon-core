* The generation of helm charts and yaml manifests relies on kubebuilder-generated manifests in
  `../operator/config/[files]`.

* If you have modified CRD definitions in the operator (`../operator/apis/mlops/v1alpha1/*` and
  dependencies), you must first run `make manifests` in the operator directory to update the manifests.
  Only then you should run `make create` in this directory.

* Never modify files in `../operator/config/[files]` manually. These files are generated by 
  kubebuilder. Instead, modify the CRD definitions in the operator code
