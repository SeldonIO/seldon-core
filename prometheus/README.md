# Prometheus

## Install

We recommend install [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack) that provides an all-in-one package with the [Prometheus operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator).

```
kubectl apply --server-side -f manifests/setup
until kubectl get servicemonitors --all-namespaces ; do date; sleep 1; echo ""; done
kubectl apply -f manifests/
```

### RBAC

You will need to modify the default RBAC installed by kube-prometheus as described [here](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/main/Documentation/user-guides/getting-started.md#enable-rbac-rules-for-prometheus-pods).

```
kubectl apply -f rbac/cr.yaml
```

## Monitors

We use a PodMonitor for scrapping agent metrics. The envoy and server monitors are there for completeness but not present needed.

```
kubectl apply -f monitors
```

Includes:

 * Agent pod monitor. Monitors the metrics port of server inference pods.
 * Server pod monitor. Monitors the server-metrics port of server inference pods.
 * Envoy service monitor. Monitors the Envoy proxies.
 * Pipeline gateway service monitor. Monitors seldon defined metrics for pipelines on the metrics port of pipeline gateway pods.

Pod monitors were chosen as ports for metrics are not exposed at service level as we do not have a top level service for server replicas but 1 headless service per replica. Future discussions could reference [this](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/issues/3119).
