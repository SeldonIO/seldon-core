# Canary Roll Out using Seldon-Core and Istio

This folder provides resources to illustrate how to do a canary roll out of one MNIST model to another using the canary pattern where a small amount of traffic is sent to the new model to validate it before sending all traffic to the new model.

There is a [Jupyter Notebook](canary.ipynb) that provides a step by step demo.
