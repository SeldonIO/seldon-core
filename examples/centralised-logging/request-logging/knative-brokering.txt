First install eventing.

Then in-memory channel provisioner.

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knative/eventing/master/config/provisioners/in-memory-channel/in-memory-channel.yaml

Create broker following knative.dev/docs/eventing/broker-trigger/

Seem to be hitting https://github.com/knative/eventing/issues/1383
:(

But I am getting ImagePullBackOff from kafka-ch-controller, kafka-ch-dispatcher, kafka-channel-dispatcher and kafka-webhook

This is not surprising as the images have names like 'github.com/knative/eventing/contrib/kafka/cmd/webhook' :(

Looks like you have to build them locally https://github.com/knative/eventing-contrib/issues/299

Create service:

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knative/docs/master/docs/eventing/samples/container-source/service.yaml

And trigger:

kubectl apply -f ./trigger.yaml
