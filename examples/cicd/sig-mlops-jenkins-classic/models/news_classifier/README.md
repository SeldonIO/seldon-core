# News Classifier

Implementation of a news classifier model using Scikit Learn's Naive Bayes implementation.
Since this model is implemented using Scikit Learn, we can deploy it using [one of Seldon's pre-built re-usable server](https://docs.seldon.io/projects/seldon-core/en/latest/servers/sklearn.html).

## Training

First we will train a machine learning model, which will help us classify news across multiple categories.

### Install dependencies 

We will need the following dependencies in order to run the Python code:


```python
%%writefile ./src/requirements.txt
# You need the right versions for your model server:
# Model servers: https://docs.seldon.io/projects/seldon-core/en/latest/servers/overview.html

# For SKLearn you need a pickle and the following:
scikit-learn==0.20.3 # See https://docs.seldon.io/projects/seldon-core/en/latest/servers/sklearn.html
joblib==0.13.2

# For XGBoost you need v 0.82 and an xgboost export (not a pickle)
#xgboost==0.82

# For MLFlow you need the following, and a link to the built model:
#mlflow==1.1.0
#pandas==0.25

# For tensorflow, any models supported by tensorflow serving (less than v2.0)

# For testing
pytest==5.1.1

```

We can now install the dependencies using the make command:


```bash
%%bash
make install_dev
```

### Download the ML data

Now that we have all the dependencies we can proceed to download the data.

We will download the news stories dataset, and we'll be attempting to classify across the four classes below.


```python
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups
categories = ['alt.atheism', 'soc.religion.christian',
              'comp.graphics', 'sci.med']

twenty_train = fetch_20newsgroups(
    subset='train', categories=categories, shuffle=True, random_state=42)

twenty_test = fetch_20newsgroups(
    subset='test', categories=categories, shuffle=True, random_state=42)

# Printing the top 3 newstories
print("\n".join(twenty_train.data[0].split("\n")[:3]))
```

    Downloading 20news dataset. This may take a few minutes.
    Downloading dataset from https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/5975967 (14 MB)

### Train a model

Now that we've downloaded the data, we can train the ML model using a simple pipeline with basic text pre-processors and a Multiclass naive bayes classifier


```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfTransformer, CountVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB

text_clf = Pipeline([
    ('vect', CountVectorizer()),
    ('tfidf', TfidfTransformer()),
    ('clf', MultinomialNB()),
])

text_clf.fit(twenty_train.data, twenty_train.target)
```




    Pipeline(memory=None,
         steps=[('vect', CountVectorizer(analyzer='word', binary=False, decode_error='strict',
            dtype=<class 'numpy.int64'>, encoding='utf-8', input='content',
            lowercase=True, max_df=1.0, max_features=None, min_df=1,
            ngram_range=(1, 1), preprocessor=None, stop_words=None,
            strip...inear_tf=False, use_idf=True)), ('clf', MultinomialNB(alpha=1.0, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True))])



### Test single prediction

Now that we've trained our model we can use it to predict from un-seen data.

We can see below that the model is able to predict the first datapoint in the dataset correctly.


```python
idx = 0
print(f"CONTENT:{twenty_test.data[idx][35:230]}\n\n-----------\n")
print(f"PREDICTED CLASS: {categories[twenty_test.target[idx]]}")
```

    CONTENT:
    Subject: Re: HELP for Kidney Stones ..............
    Organization: The Avant-Garde of the Now, Ltd.
    Lines: 12
    NNTP-Posting-Host: ucsd.edu
    
    As I recall from my bout with kidney stones, there isn't 
    
    -----------
    
    PREDICTED CLASS: comp.graphics


### Print accuracy

We can print the accuracy of the model by running the test data and counting the number of correct classes.


```python
import numpy as np

predicted = text_clf.predict(twenty_test.data)
print(f"Accuracy: {np.mean(predicted == twenty_test.target):.2f}")
```

    Accuracy: 0.83


## Deployment

Now we want to be able to deploy the model we just trained. This will just be as simple as updated the model binary.

### Save the trained model

First we have to save the trained model in the `src/` folder.
This is the binary that we will upload to our cloud storage (which acts as model registry) and which our wrapper will load.


```python
import joblib
joblib.dump(text_clf, "src/model.joblib")
```




    ['src/model.joblib']



### Update your unit test

We'll write a very simple unit test that make sure that the model loads and runs as expected.


```python
%%writefile src/test_model.py
import numpy as np
from unittest import mock
import joblib
import os

EXPECTED_RESPONSE = np.array([3, 3])

def test_model(*args, **kwargs):
    data = ["text 1", "text 2"]

    m = joblib.load("model.joblib")
    result = m.predict(data)
    assert all(result == EXPECTED_RESPONSE)

```

    Overwriting src/test_model.py



```bash
%%bash
make test
```

### Updating Integration Tests

We can also now update the integration tests. This is another very simple step, where we'll want to test this model specifically.

### Now push your changes to trigger the pipeline
Because Jenkins Classic has created a CI GitOps pipeline for our repo we just need to push our changes to run all the tests

We can do this by running our good old git commands:


```bash
%%bash
git add .
git push origin master
```

We can now see that the pipeline has been triggered by going to the Status page inside Jenkins pipeline:

![Pipeline Progress](./images/pipeline-progress.png)

Similarly we can actually see the logs of our running job by going to the Console Output page:

![Build logs](./images/build-logs.png)

## Managing your ML Application

Now that we've deployed our MLOps repo, Argo CD will sync the model implementation repository charts with our Staging environ ment automatically.


```bash
%%bash
kubectl get pods -n staging
```
