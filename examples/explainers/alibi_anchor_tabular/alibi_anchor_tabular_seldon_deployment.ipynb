    "\n",
    "The objective of this tutorial is to build a \"loan approval\" predictor using the Income classifier dataset to showcase the importance of black-box model explainers, which in this case are built using our open source framework [Alibi](http://github.com/SeldonIO/Alibi). The diagram of this tutorial is as follows:\n",

    "In this tutorial we will follow the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Train a model to predict loan approvals\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Containerise and deploy your model\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Create an explainer to understand predictions\n",

    "4) Containerise and deploy your explainer\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Test the predictions as well as explanations\n",

    "Make sure you install the following dependencies, as they are critical for this example to work:\n",

    "* Helm v3.0.0+\n",
    "* A Kubernetes cluster running v1.13 or above (minkube / docker-for-windows work well if enough RAM)\n",

    "* ksonnet v0.13.1+\n",
    "* kfctl 0.5.1 - Please use this exact version as there are major changes every few months\n",
    "* Python 3.6+\n",
    "* Python DEV requirements (we'll install them below)\n",
