    "# MLFlow Pre-packaged Model Server AB Test Deployment \n",
    "In this example we will build two models with MLFlow and we will deploy them as an A/B test deployment. The reason this is powerful is because it allows you to deploy a new model next to the old one, distributing a percentage of traffic. These deployment strategies are quite simple using Seldon, and can be extended to shadow deployments, multi-armed-bandits, etc."
