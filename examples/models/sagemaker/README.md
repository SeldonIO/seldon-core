# AWS Sagemaker and Seldon Core

In this tutorial we will show how to train a model using [AWS Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) and then deploy it locally on Seldon Core. An example showing this for a scikit-learn Iris model is shown in the [Jupyter notebook](sagemaker_seldon_scikit_iris_example.ipynb).
