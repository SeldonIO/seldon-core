# SKLearn Spacy Reddit Text Classification Example

In this example we will be buiding a text classifier using the reddit content moderation dataset.

For this, we will be using SpaCy for the word tokenization and lemmatization. 

The classification will be done with a Logistic Regression binary classifier.

The steps in this tutorial include:

1) Train and build your NLP model

2) Build your containerized model

3) Test your model as a docker container

4) Run Seldon in your kubernetes cluster

5) Deploy your model with Seldon

6) Interact with your model through API

7) Clean your environment


### Before you start
Make sure you install the following dependencies, as they are critical for this example to work:

* Helm v2.13.1+
* A Kubernetes cluster running v1.13 or above (minkube / docker-for-windows work well if enough RAM)
* kubectl v1.14+
* Python 3.6+
* Python DEV requirements (we'll install them below)

Let's get started! ðŸš€ðŸ”¥

## 1) Train and build your NLP model


```python
# Let's first install any dependencies
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```


```python
import pandas as pd 
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import numpy as np
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from seldon_core.seldon_client import SeldonClient
import dill
import sys, os

# This import may take a while as it will download the Spacy ENGLISH model
from ml_utils import CleanTextTransformer, SpacyTokenTransformer
```


```python
df_cols = ["prev_idx", "parent_idx", "body", "removed"]

TEXT_COLUMN = "body" 
CLEAN_COLUMN = "clean_body"
TOKEN_COLUMN = "token_body"

# Downloading the 50k reddit dataset of moderated comments
df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axsauze/reddit-classification-exploration/master/data/reddit_train.csv", 
                         names=df_cols, skiprows=1, encoding="ISO-8859-1")

df.head()
```

            with open('tfidf_vectorizer.model', 'rb') as model_file:
                self._tfidf_vectorizer = dill.load(model_file)
               
            with open('lr.model', 'rb') as model_file:

            spacy_tokens = self._spacy_tokenizer.transform(clean_text)
            tfidf_features = self._tfidf_vectorizer.transform(spacy_tokens)
            predictions = self._lr_model.predict_proba(tfidf_features)
            return predictions
    



```python
# test that our model works
from RedditClassifier import RedditClassifier
# With one sample
sample = x_test[0:1]
print(sample)
print(RedditClassifier().predict(sample, ["feature_name"]))

### Create Docker Image with the S2i utility
Using the S2I command line interface we wrap our current model to seve it through the Seldon interface


```python
# To create a docker image we need to create the .s2i folder configuration as below:
!cat .s2i/environment
```

    MODEL_NAME=RedditClassifier
    API_TYPE=REST
    SERVICE_TYPE=MODEL
    PERSISTENCE=0



```python
# As well as a requirements.txt file with all the relevant dependencies

## 3) Test your model as a docker container


```python
# Remove previously deployed containers for this model
!docker rm -f reddit_predictor
```

    Error: No such container: reddit_predictor



```python
!docker run --name "reddit_predictor" -d --rm -p 5001:5000 reddit-classifier:0.1
```

### Make sure you wait for language model
SpaCy will download the English language model, so you have to make sure the container finishes downloading it before it can be used. You can view this by running the logs until you see "Linking successful".


```python
# Here we need to wait until we see "Linking successful", as it's downloading the Spacy English model
# You can hit stop when this happens
!docker logs -t -f reddit_predictor
```

## 4) Run Seldon in your kubernetes cluster
In order to run Seldon we need to make sure that Helm is initialised and Tiller is running. 

For this we can run the following initialisation and waiting commands.


```python
# If not running you can install it
# First initialise helm
!kubectl create clusterrolebinding kube-system-cluster-admin --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:default
!helm init
!kubectl rollout status deploy/tiller-deploy -n kube-system
```

    clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/kube-system-cluster-admin created
    $HELM_HOME has been configured at /home/alejandro/.helm.
    Warning: Tiller is already installed in the cluster.
    (Use --client-only to suppress this message, or --upgrade to upgrade Tiller to the current version.)
    Happy Helming!
    deployment "tiller-deploy" successfully rolled out


Now we can install run the Seldon Operator using the latest Helm charts


```python
!helm install seldon-core-operator --name seldon-core-operator --repo https://storage.googleapis.com/seldon-charts
```

    NOTES:
    Congratuations! You've successfully installed Ambassador.
    
    For help, visit our Slack at https://d6e.co/slack or view the documentation online at https://www.getambassador.io.
    
    To get the IP address of Ambassador, run the following commands:
    NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available.
         You can watch the status of by running 'kubectl get svc -w  --namespace default ambassador'
    
      On GKE/Azure:
      export SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc --namespace default ambassador -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
    
      On AWS:
      export SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc --namespace default ambassador -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}')
    
      echo http://$SERVICE_IP:
    


We can now see the ambassador service is running. In our case we can reach it through the external IP which is our localhost, but if you are using a cloud provider, make sure you have access to the ambassador endpoint.


```python
!kubectl get svc ambassador
```

    NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE

## 5) Deploy your model with Seldon
We can now deploy our model by using the Seldon graph definition:


```python
# We'll use our seldon deployment file
!cat reddit_clf.json
```

## 6) Interact with your model through API
Now that our Seldon Deployment is live, we are able to interact with it through its API.

There are two options in which we can interact with our new model. These are:

a) Using CURL from the CLI (or another rest client like Postman)

b) Using the Python SeldonClient

#### a) Using CURL from the CLI


```bash
%%bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d "{'data': {'names': ['text'], 'ndarray': ['Hello world this is a test']}}" \
    http://127.0.0.1/seldon/default/reddit-classifier/api/v0.1/predictions
```

    {
      "meta": {
        "puid": "bvj1rjiq3vvnieo0oir4h7bf6f",
        "tags": {
        },
        "routing": {
        },
        "requestPath": {
          "classifier": "reddit-classifier:0.1"
        },
        "metrics": []
      },
      "data": {
        "names": ["t:0", "t:1"],
        "ndarray": [[0.6815614604065544, 0.3184385395934456]]
      }
    }

      % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                     Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
    100   372  100   300  100    72   1522    365 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  1897


#### b) Using the Python SeldonClient


```python
from seldon_core.seldon_client import SeldonClient
import numpy as np

host = "localhost"
port = "80" # Make sure you use the port above
batch = np.array(["Hello world this is a test"])
payload_type = "ndarray"
deployment_name="reddit-classifier"
transport="rest"
namespace="default"

sc = SeldonClient(
    gateway="ambassador", 
    ambassador_endpoint=host + ":" + port,
    namespace=namespace)

client_prediction = sc.predict(
    data=batch, 
    deployment_name=deployment_name,
    names=["text"],
    payload_type=payload_type,
    transport="rest")

print(client_prediction)
```

    Success:True message:
    Request:
    data {
      names: "text"
      ndarray {
        values {
          string_value: "Hello world this is a test"
        }
      }
    }
    
    Response:
    meta {
      puid: "uld2famhfrb97vd7regu0q7k32"
      requestPath {
        key: "classifier"
        value: "reddit-classifier:0.1"
      }
    }
    data {
      names: "t:0"
      names: "t:1"
      ndarray {
        values {
          list_value {
            values {
              number_value: 0.6815614604065544
            }
            values {
              number_value: 0.3184385395934456
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    


## 7) Clean your environment


```python
!kubectl delete -f reddit_clf.json
```


```python
!helm del --purge ambassador
```

    release "ambassador" deleted



```python
!helm del --purge seldon-core-operator
```

    release "seldon-core-operator" deleted



```python

```
