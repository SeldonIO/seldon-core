    "# Pachyderm-Seldon Integration: Version Controlled Models\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pachyderm](https://pachyderm.io/) is a data science platform that combines Data Lineage with End-to-End Pipelines. [Seldon-Core](https://www.seldon.io/tech/products/core/) is an open-source platform for rapidly deploying machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show you how to perform data-driven model training using Pachyderm and deploy that model using Seldon-Core. This represents the simplest integration between Pachyderm and Seldon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "The highlight in this example is the use of Pachyderm's S3 gateway, where version controlled pachyderm repositories are exposed via an S3-like API. This means that Seldon-Core's pre-packaged model servers, which typically read from blob storage, can read directly from Pachyderm.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implements the machine learning best practice of provenance. You can trace the model artifact's lineage right back to the version of the data that it was trained on, without making any changes to your usual way of working.\n",
    "\n",
    "![overview image](./images/pachyderm-simple-demo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    " * A kubernetes cluster with kubectl configured\n",
    " * [A seldon-core cluster installed and configured](https://docs.seldon.io/projects/seldon-core/en/latest/examples/seldon_core_setup.html)\n",
    " * `curl`\n",
    " * Pachyderm's `pachctl` binary installed following the [official documentation](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/getting_started/local_installation/#install-pachctl)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pachyderm is controlled and deployed via the `pachctl`. This document assumes that you have version `1.11.8` installed, although it should work with any `1.x.x` version."

    "Pachyderm Pipelines are the computational component of the Pachyderm platform. They are responsible for reading data from a specified source, such as a Pachyderm repo, transforming it according to the pipeline configuration, and writing the result to an output repo. Pachyderm pipelines can be easily chained together to create a directed acyclic graph (DAG).\n",
    "\n",

    "This uses a container built from the [iris-train-python-svm](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/tree/master/examples/pachyderm-simple/iris-train-python-svm) directory to perform the training, but you could use your own. The input is defined to be the `training` Pachyderm repository and the output will be stored in a repository with the same name as the pipeline (`model`). Remember to push the container to somewhere that the cluster can acccess. For example, you can use the `make kind_load` target in the [Makefile](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/blob/master/examples/pachyderm-simple/iris-train-python-svm/Makefile) to push the container to a `kind` cluster."
