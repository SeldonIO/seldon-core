# End-to-end Reusable ML Pipeline with Seldon and Kubeflow

In this example we showcase how to build re-usable components to build an ML pipeline that can be trained and deployed at scale.

We will automate content moderation on the Reddit comments in /r/science building a machine learning NLP model with the following components:

![](img/completed-pipeline-deploy.jpg)

This tutorial will break down in the following sections:

1) Run all the services (Kubeflow and Seldon)

2) Test and build all our reusable pipeline steps

3) Use Kubeflow to Train the Pipeline and Deploy to Seldon

5) Test Seldon Deployed ML REST Endpoints

6) Visualise Seldon's Production ML Pipelines

# Before you start
Make sure you install the following dependencies, as they are critical for this example to work:

* Helm v2.13.1+
* A Kubernetes cluster running v1.13 or above (minkube / docker-for-windows work well if enough RAM)
* kubectl v1.14+
* ksonnet v0.13.1+
* kfctl 0.5.1 - Please use this exact version as there are major changes every few months
* Python 3.6+
* Python DEV requirements (we'll install them below)

Let's get started! ðŸš€ðŸ”¥ We will be building the end-to-end pipeline below:

![](img/kubeflow-seldon-nlp-full.jpg)



```python
!cat requirements-dev.txt
```

    python-dateutil
    https://storage.googleapis.com/ml-pipeline/release/0.1.20/kfp.tar.gz
    kubernetes
    click
    seldon_core
    numpy



```python
!pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## 1) Run all the services (Kubeflow and Seldon)
Kubeflow's CLI allows us to create a project which will allow us to build the configuration we need to deploy our kubeflow and seldon clusters.


```python
!kfctl init kubeflow-seldon
!ls kubeflow-seldon
```

    app.yaml


Now we run the following commands to basically launch our Kubeflow cluster with all its components. 

It may take a while to download all the images for Kubeflow so feel free to make yourself a cup of â˜•.

If you have a terminal you can see how the containers are created in real-time by running `kubectl get pods -n kubeflow -w`.


```bash
%%bash
cd kubeflow-seldon
kfctl generate all -V
kfctl apply all -V
```

### Now let's run Seldon 
For this we'll need Helm to be running, so we'll initialise it.


```bash
%%bash
helm init 
kubectl rollout status deploy/tiller-deploy -n kube-system
```

    $HELM_HOME has been configured at /home/alejandro/.helm.
    Warning: Tiller is already installed in the cluster.
    (Use --client-only to suppress this message, or --upgrade to upgrade Tiller to the current version.)
    Happy Helming!
    deployment "tiller-deploy" successfully rolled out


Once it's running we can now run the installation command for Seldon.

As you can see, we are running the Seldon Operator in the Kubeflow namespace. 


```python
!helm install seldon-core-operator --namespace kubeflow --repo https://storage.googleapis.com/seldon-charts
```

```

    seldon-operator-controller-manager-0                       1/1     Running   1          6s


### Temporary fix for Argo image

At the time of writing we need to make some updates in the Argo images with the following commands below.

(This basically changes the images to the latest ones, otherwise we will get an error when we attach the volume)



```python
!kubectl -n kubeflow patch deployments. workflow-controller --patch '{"spec": {"template": {"spec": {"containers": [{"name": "workflow-controller", "image": "argoproj/workflow-controller:v2.3.0-rc3"}]}}}}'
!kubectl -n kubeflow patch deployments. ml-pipeline --patch '{"spec": {"template": {"spec": {"containers": [{"name": "ml-pipeline-api-server", "image": "elikatsis/ml-pipeline-api-server:0.1.18-pick-1289"}]}}}}'
# !kubectl -n kubeflow patch configmaps workflow-controller-configmap --patch '{"data": {"config": "{ executorImage: argoproj/argoexec:v2.3.0-rc3,artifactRepository:{s3: {bucket: mlpipeline,keyPrefix: artifacts,endpoint: minio-service.kubeflow:9000,insecure: true,accessKeySecret: {name: mlpipeline-minio-artifact,key: accesskey},secretKeySecret: {name: mlpipeline-minio-artifact,key: secretkey}}}}" }}'
```

    deployment.extensions/workflow-controller patched
    deployment.extensions/ml-pipeline patched


The last command you need to run actually needs to be manual as the patch cannot change configmap contents directly

You need to run the edit commad and change the executorImage to: `argoproj/argoexec:v2.3.0-rc3`

The command should be run from a terminal:

```
kubectl edit configmaps workflow-controller-configmap -n kubeflow
```

## 2) Test and build all our reusable pipeline steps

We will start by building each of the components in our ML pipeline. 

![](img/kubeflow-seldon-nlp-reusable-components.jpg)

### Let's first have a look at our clean_text step:



```python
!ls pipeline/pipeline_steps
```

    clean_text	 lr_text_classifier  tfidf_vectorizer
    data_downloader  spacy_tokenize


Like in this step, all of the other steps can be found in the `pipeline/pipeline_steps/` folder, and all have the following structure:
* `pipeline_step.py` which exposes the functionality through a CLI 
* `Transformer.py` which transforms the data accordingly
* `requirements.txt` which states the python dependencies to run
* `build_image.sh` which uses `s2i` to build the image with one line

### Let's check out the CLI for clean_text
The pipeline_step CLI is the entry point for the kubeflow image as it will be able to pass any relevant parameters



```python
!python pipeline/pipeline_steps/clean_text/pipeline_step.py --help
```

    Usage: pipeline_step.py [OPTIONS]
    
    Options:
      --in-path TEXT
      --out-path TEXT
      --help           Show this message and exit.


This is actually a very simple file, as we are using the click library to define the commands:



```python
!cat pipeline/pipeline_steps/clean_text/pipeline_step.py
```

    import dill
    import click
    import dill
    try:
        # Running for tests
        from .Transformer import Transformer
    except:
        # Running from CLI
        from Transformer import Transformer
    
    @click.command()
    @click.option('--in-path', default="/mnt/raw_text.data")
    @click.option('--out-path', default="/mnt/clean_text.data")
    def run_pipeline(in_path, out_path):
        clean_text_transformer = Transformer()
        with open(in_path, 'rb') as in_f:
            x = dill.load(in_f)
        y = clean_text_transformer.predict(x)
        with open(out_path, "wb") as out_f:
            dill.dump(y, out_f)
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        run_pipeline()
    


The Transformer is where the data munging and transformation stage comes in, which will be wrapped by the container and exposed through the Seldon Engine to ensure our pipeline can be used in production.

Seldon provides multiple different features, such as abilities to send custom metrics, pre-process / post-process data and more. In this example we will only be exposing the `predict` step.


```python
!cat pipeline/pipeline_steps/clean_text/Transformer.py
```

    import re 
    from html.parser import HTMLParser
    import numpy as np
    import logging
    
    class Transformer():
        __html_parser = HTMLParser()
        __uplus_pattern = \
            re.compile("\<[uU]\+(?P<digit>[a-zA-Z0-9]+)\>")
        __markup_link_pattern = \
            re.compile("\[(.*)\]\((.*)\)")
    
        def predict(self, X, feature_names=[]):
            logging.warning(X)
            f = np.vectorize(Transformer.transform_clean_text)
            X_clean = f(X)
            logging.warning(X_clean)
            return X_clean
    
        def fit(self, X, y=None, **fit_params):
            return self
        
        @staticmethod
        def transform_clean_text(raw_text):
            try:
                decoded = raw_text.encode("ISO-8859-1").decode("utf-8")
            except:
                decoded = raw_text.encode("ISO-8859-1").decode("cp1252")
            html_unescaped =Transformer.\
                __html_parser.unescape(decoded) 
            html_unescaped = re.sub(r"\r\n", " ", html_unescaped)
            html_unescaped = re.sub(r"\r\r\n", " ", html_unescaped)
            html_unescaped = re.sub(r"\r", " ", html_unescaped)
            html_unescaped = html_unescaped.replace("&gt;", " > ")
            html_unescaped = html_unescaped.replace("&lt;", " < ")
            html_unescaped = html_unescaped.replace("--", " - ")
            html_unescaped = Transformer.__uplus_pattern.sub(
                " U\g<digit> ", html_unescaped)
            html_unescaped = Transformer.__markup_link_pattern.sub(
                " \1 \2 ", html_unescaped)
            html_unescaped = html_unescaped.replace("\\", "")
            return html_unescaped
    


If you want to understand how the CLI pipeline talks to each other, have a look at the end to end test in `pipeline/pipeline_tests/`:


```python
!pytest ./pipeline/pipeline_tests/. --disable-pytest-warnings
```

    [1m============================= test session starts ==============================[0m

    [33m[1m===================== 1 passed, 9 warnings in 3.26 seconds =====================[0m


To build the image we provide a build script in each of the steps that contains the instructions:


```python
!cat pipeline/pipeline_steps/clean_text/build_image.sh
```

    #!/bin/bash
    
    s2i build . seldonio/seldon-core-s2i-python3:0.6 clean_text_transformer:0.1
    


The only thing you need to make sure is that Seldon knows how to wrap the right model and file.

This can be achieved with the s2i/environment file. 

As you can see, here we just tell it we want it to use our `Transformer.py` file:



```python
!cat pipeline/pipeline_steps/clean_text/.s2i/environment
```

    MODEL_NAME=Transformer
    API_TYPE=REST
    SERVICE_TYPE=MODEL
    PERSISTENCE=0


Once this is defined, the only thing we need to do is to run the `build_image.sh` for all the reusable components.

Here we show the manual way to do it:


```bash
%%bash
# we must be in the same directory
cd pipeline/pipeline_steps/clean_text/ && ./build_image.sh
cd ../data_downloader && ./build_image.sh
cd ../lr_text_classifier && ./build_image.sh
cd ../spacy_tokenize && ./build_image.sh
cd ../tfidf_vectorizer && ./build_image.sh
```

## 3) Train our NLP Pipeline through the Kubeflow UI
We can access the Kubeflow dashboard to train our ML pipeline via http://localhost/_/pipeline-dashboard

If you can't edit this, you need to make sure that the ambassador gateway service is accessible:



```python
!kubectl get svc ambassador -n kubeflow
```

    NAME         TYPE       CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
    ambassador   NodePort   10.97.236.196   <none>        80:30209/TCP   8m58s


In my case, I need to change the kind from `NodePort` into `LoadBalancer` which can be done with the following command:



```python
!kubectl patch svc ambassador --type='json' -p '[{"op":"replace","path":"/spec/type","value":"LoadBalancer"}]' -n kubeflow
```

    service/ambassador patched


Now that I've changed it to a loadbalancer, it has allocated the external IP as my localhost so I can access it at http://localhost/_/pipeline-dashboard



```python
!kubectl get svc ambassador -n kubeflow
```

    NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
    ambassador   LoadBalancer   10.97.236.196   localhost     80:30209/TCP   9m20s


If this was successfull, you should be able to access the dashboard

### Define the pipeline
Now we want to generate the pipeline. For this we can use the DSL provided by kubeflow to define the actual steps required. 

The pipeline will look as follows:

![](img/kubeflow-seldon-nlp-ml-pipelines.jpg)


```python
!cat train_pipeline/nlp_pipeline.py
```

    if __name__ == '__main__':
      import kfp.compiler as compiler
      compiler.Compiler().compile(nlp_pipeline, __file__ + '.tar.gz')


### Breaking down the  code
As you can see in the DSL, we have the ContainerOp - each of those is a step in the Kubeflow pipeline.

At the end we can see the `seldondeploy` step which basically deploys the trained pipeline

The definition of the SeldonDeployment graph is provided in the `deploy_pipeline/seldon_production_pipeline.yaml` file.

The seldondeployment file defines our production execution graph using the same reusable components.


```python
!cat deploy_pipeline/seldon_production_pipeline.yaml
```

### Seldon Production pipeline contents
If we look at the file we'll be using to deploy our pipeline, we can see that it has the following key points:

1) Reusable components definitions as containerSpecs: cleantext, spacytokenizer, tfidfvectorizer & lrclassifier

2) DAG (directed acyclic graph) definition for REST pipeline: cleantext -> spacytokenizer -> tfidfvectorizer -> lrclassifier

This graph in our production deployment looks as follows:

![](img/kubeflow-seldon-nlp-ml-pipelines-deploy.jpg)

### Generate the pipeline files to upload to Kubeflow
To generate the pipeline we just have to run the pipeline file, which will output the `tar.gz` file that will be uploaded.


```bash
%%bash
# Generating graph definition
python train_pipeline/nlp_pipeline.py
ls train_pipeline/
```

    nlp_pipeline.py
    nlp_pipeline.py.tar.gz



### Run the pipeline

We now need to upload the resulting `nlp_pipeline.py.tar.gz` file generated.

This can be done through the "Upload PIpeline" button in the UI at http://localhost/_/pipeline-dashboard.

Once it's uploaded, we want to create and trigger a run! You should now be able to see how each step is executed:

![](img/running-pipeline.jpg)

### Inspecting the data created in the Persistent Volume
The pipeline saves the output of the pipeline together with the trained model in the persistent volume claim.

The persistent volume claim is the same name as the argo workflow:



```python
!kubectl get workflow -n kubeflow
```

    NAME        AGE
    nlp-bddff   2m


Our workflow is there! So we can actually access it by running


```python
!kubectl get workflow -n kubeflow -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}'
```

    nlp-bddff

And we can use good old `sed` to insert this workflow name in our PVC-Access controler which we can use to inspect the contents of the volume:


```python
!sed "s/PVC_NAME/"$(kubectl get workflow -n kubeflow -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')"-my-pvc/g" deploy_pipeline/pvc-access.yaml 
```

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: pvc-access-container
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pvc-access-container
        image: busybox
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-ec", "sleep 1000"]
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mypvc
          mountPath: /mnt
      volumes:
      - name: mypvc
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: nlp-b7qt8-my-pvc


We just need to apply this container with our kubectl command, and we can use it to inspect the mounted folder:


```python
!sed "s/PVC_NAME/"$(kubectl get workflow -n kubeflow -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')"-my-pvc/g" deploy_pipeline/pvc-access.yaml | kubectl -n kubeflow apply -f -
```

    pod/pvc-access-container created



```python
!kubectl get pods -n kubeflow pvc-access-container
```

    NAME                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    pvc-access-container   1/1     Running   0          6s


Now we can run an `ls` command to see what's inside:


```python
!kubectl -n kubeflow exec -it pvc-access-container ls /mnt
```

    [1;32mclean.data[m       [1;32mlr.model[m         [1;32mtext.data[m        [1;32mtfidf.model[m
    [1;32mlabels.data[m      [1;32mprediction.data[m  [1;32mtfidf.data[m       [1;32mtokens.data[m



```python
!kubectl delete -f deploy_pipeline/pvc-access.yaml -n kubeflow
```

    pod "pvc-access-container" deleted


## 5) Test Deployed ML REST Endpoints
Now that it's running we have a production ML text pipeline that we can Query using REST and GRPC


First we can check if our Seldon deployment is running with


```python
!kubectl -n kubeflow get seldondeployment 
```

    NAME                          AGE
    seldon-deployment-nlp-b7qt8   57m


We will need the Seldon Pipeline Deployment name to reach the API, so we can get it using:


```python
!kubectl -n kubeflow get seldondeployment -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}'
```

    seldon-deployment-nlp-b7qt8

Now we can interact with our API in two ways: 

1) Using CURL or any client like PostMan

2) Using the Python SeldonClient

### Using CURL from the terminal
When using CURL, the only thing we need to provide is the data in JSON format, as well as the url, which is of the format:

```
http://<ENDPOINT>/seldon/kubeflow/<PIPELINE_NAME>/api/v0.1/predictions
```


```bash
%%bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d "{'data': {'names': ['text'], 'ndarray': ['Hello world this is a test']}}" \
    http://127.0.0.1/seldon/kubeflow/$(kubectl -n kubeflow get seldondeployment -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')/api/v0.1/predictions
```

      }
    }

### Using the SeldonClient
We can also use the Python SeldonClient to interact with the pipeline we just deployed 


```python
from seldon_core.seldon_client import SeldonClient
import numpy as np
import subprocess

host = "localhost"
port = "80" # Make sure you use the port above
batch = np.array(["Hello world this is a test"])
payload_type = "ndarray"
# Get the deployment name
deployment_name = subprocess.getoutput("kubectl -n kubeflow get seldondeployment -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}'")
transport="rest"
namespace="kubeflow"

sc = SeldonClient(
    gateway="ambassador", 
    ambassador_endpoint=host + ":" + port,
    namespace=namespace)

client_prediction = sc.predict(
    data=batch, 
    deployment_name=deployment_name,
    names=["text"],
    payload_type=payload_type,
    transport="rest")

print(client_prediction)
```

    Success:True message:
    Request:
    data {
      names: "text"
      ndarray {
        values {
          string_value: "Hello world this is a test"
        }
      }
    }

        value: -1
      }
      routing {
        key: "spacytokenizer"
        value: -1
      }
      routing {

        value: -1
      }
      requestPath {

        value: "clean_text_transformer:0.1"
      }
      requestPath {
        key: "lrclassifier"
        value: "lr_text_classifier:0.1"
      }
      requestPath {
        key: "spacytokenizer"
        value: "spacy_tokenizer:0.1"
      }
      requestPath {
        key: "tfidfvectorizer"
        value: "tfidf_vectorizer:0.1"
      }
    }
    data {
      names: "t:0"
      names: "t:1"
      ndarray {
        values {
          list_value {
            values {
              number_value: 0.6729318752883149
            }
            values {
              number_value: 0.3270681247116851
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    


## 6) Visualise Seldon's Production ML Pipelines
We can visualise the performance using the SeldonAnalytics package, which we can deploy using:


```python
!helm install seldon-core-analytics --repo https://storage.googleapis.com/seldon-charts --namespace kubeflow
```

In my case, similar to what I did with Ambassador, I need to make sure the the service is a LoadBalancer instead of a NodePort


```python
!kubectl patch svc grafana-prom --type='json' -p '[{"op":"replace","path":"/spec/type","value":"LoadBalancer"}]' -n kubeflow
```

    service/grafana-prom patched



```python
!kubectl get svc grafana-prom -n kubeflow
```

    NAME           TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
    grafana-prom   LoadBalancer   10.98.248.223   localhost     80:32445/TCP   64m


Now we can access it at the port provided, in my case it is http://localhost:32445/d/3swM2iGWz/prediction-analytics?refresh=5s&orgId=1

(initial username is admin and password is password, which will be requested to be changed on the first login)

Generate a bunch of requests and visualise:


```python
while True:
    client_prediction = sc.predict(
        data=batch, 
        deployment_name=deployment_name,
        names=["text"],
        payload_type=payload_type,
        transport="rest")
```

## You now have a full end-to-end training and production NLP pipeline ðŸ˜Ž
