    "Most of the time, the requests that we send to our model need some kind of processing.\n",
    "For example, extra information may need to be fetched (e.g. from a feature store), or processed, in order to obtain the actual tensors required by the model. One example for this use case are NLP models, where natural language needs first to be tokenised according to a vocabulary, or embedded by a 2nd model. \n",

    "In order to create a custom pre-processing step, the first step will be to [write a **custom runtime**](https://mlserver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/runtimes/custom.html) using [MLServer](https://mlserver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",
    "MLServer is a production-grade inference server, whose main goal is to ease up the serving of models through a REST and gRPC interface compatible with the [V2 Inference Protocol](https://kserve.github.io/website/modelserving/inference_api/).\n",

    "As well as an inference server, MLServer also exposes a *framework* which can be leveraged to easily **write your custom inference runtimes**.\n",
    "These custom runtimes can be used to write any custom logic, including (you guessed it!) our tokeniser pre-processor.\n",
    "Therefore, we will start by extending the base `mlserver.MLModel` class, adding our custom logic.\n",
