# Seldon Core ![API](./doc/source/seldon.png)

Seldon Core is an open source platform for deploying machine learning models on a Kubernetes cluster.

 * Deploy machine learning models in the cloud or on-premise.
 * Get metrics and ensure proper governance and compliance for your running machine learning models.
 * Create powerful inference graphs made up of multiple components.
 * Provide a consistent serving layer for models built using heterogeneous ML toolkits.

## So Why Seldon?

 * Lets you focus on your model by [making it easy to serve on kubernetes](https://docs.seldon.io/projects/seldon-core/en/latest/workflow/README.html)
 * The same workflow and base API for a range of toolkits such as scikit-learn, tensorflow and R
 * Out of the box best-practices for logging, tracing and base metrics, applicable to all models across toolkits
 * Support for deployment strategies such as running A/B test and canaries
 * Inferences graphs for microservice-based serving strategies such as multi-armed bandits or pre-processing
