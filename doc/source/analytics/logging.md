# Payload Logging

Logging of request and response payloads from your Seldon Deployment can be accomplished by adding a logging section to any part of the Seldon deployment graph. An example is shown below:

```
apiVersion: machinelearning.seldon.io/v1
kind: SeldonDeployment
metadata:
  name: seldon-model
spec:
  name: test-deployment
  predictors:
  - componentSpecs:
    - spec:
        containers:
        - image: seldonio/mock_classifier:1.3
          name: classifier
    graph:
      children: []
      endpoint:
        type: REST
      name: classifier
      type: MODEL
      logger:
        url: http://mylogging-endpoint
        mode: all
    name: example
    replicas: 1

```

The logging for the top level requets response is provided by:

```
      logger:
        url: http://mylogging-endpoint
        mode: all
```

In this example both request and response payloads as specified by the `mode` attribute are sent as CloudEvents to the url `http://mylogging-endpoint`.

The specification is:

 * url: Any url. Optional. If not provided then it will default to the default knative borker in the namespace of the Seldon Deployment.
 * mode: Either `request`, `response` or `all`
