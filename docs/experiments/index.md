# Experiments

An Experiment defines an http traffic split between Models or Pipelines.

Experiments also allow a mirror model or pipeline to be tested where some percentage of the traffic to the main model is sent to the mirror but the result is not returned.

Further details are given [here](../kubernetes/resources/experiment/index.md).
