# Helm Install

We provide several Helm charts.

 * `seldon-core-v2-crds` : cluster wide install of custom resources
 * `seldon-core-v2-setup` : installation of core components
 * `seldon-core-v2-servers` : a default set of servers
 * `seldon-core-v2-certs` : a default set of certificates for TLS

The Helm charts can be found within the `k8s/helm-charts` folder.

Assuming you have installed any ecosystem components: Jaeger, Prometheus, Kafka as discussed [here](./index.md) you can follow the
following steps.

The Helm charts are provided as part of the repository. To use the instructions below clone the repostitory. They will be published in future.

For Kafka follow the steps discussed [here](kafka.md) 

## Install the CRDs

```bash
helm install seldon-core-v2-crds  k8s/helm-charts/seldon-core-v2-crds
```

## Install the Seldon Core V2 Components

You can install into any namespace. For illustration we will use `seldon-mesh`. By default Seldon runs in namespaced mode and needs only namespaced Roles. Model, Pipeline, Experiment Resources will need to be created in the chosen namespace.

```bash
kubectl create namespace seldon-mesh
```

```bash
helm install seldon-core-v2  k8s/helm-charts/seldon-core-v2-setup --namespace seldon-mesh
```

## Install the Default Seldon Core V2 Servers

```bash
helm install seldon-v2-servers k8s/helm-charts/seldon-core-v2-servers --namespace seldon-mesh
```

## Uninstall

Remove any models, pipelines that are running. 

Remove the servers:

```bash
helm uninstall seldon-core-v2-servers  --namespace seldon-mesh
```
Remove the core components:

```bash
helm uninstall seldon-core-v2  --namespace seldon-mesh
```

Remove the CRDs

```bash
helm uninstall seldon-core-v2-crds
